For instance, the files [Happn/data/all-data/users/uuid.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/data-catalog/blob/main/SAR/Happn/data/all-data/users/uuid.json) and [Happn/data/all-data/relationships/uuid.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/data-catalog/blob/main/SAR/Happn/data/all-data/relationships/uuid.json) show in a privacy-preserving way how Happn structures information about its users and relationships respectively. It contains no revealing information about the individual who contributed those files. 

Those files are generated through a semi-automated process, which is constantly improving.
