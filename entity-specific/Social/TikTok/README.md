# Template

> For each data actor, you need to create a folder with the exact name of the actor (e.g., "Twitter" and not "twitter").
> 
> This README file should contain a description of the actor, a description of the scripts, and a description of the templates.

## General

> Feel free to add anything that can be useful in regard to the actor, e.g.:

### What is inside the data?

### How to get the data?
* 
* Sign into your TikTok account
* Go to Profile
* Privacy> Personalize and data > Download TikTok Data

### How to delete my account?

## Inputs

> The `inputs` sub-folder contains raw data sources, which users have explicitly agreed to share publicly, and make available to the public.
> 
> It is important to have somewhere available a written statement from the user who agrees to make their data available.
> 
> In the case of large datasets, it may be interesting to upload only subsets, so as not to overload the git.
> 
> Note: this folder is gitignored by default, you have to explicit what files should be pushed.
