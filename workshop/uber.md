# Getting data from Uber or Uber Eats

To get data from Uber you have two options. To use their download portal to access standard data, use the Download Portal instructions below. For more complex or bespoke requests, use the Subject Access Requests process further down this page.
The process is the same for Uber Eats and Uber taxis. For Uber drivers, there is an option to specify you are interested in driver rather than rider data.

## Download Portal Instructions

1. On your main computer, go to [this webpage](https://auth.uber.com/login/?breeze_local_zone=dca11&next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmyprivacy.uber.com%2Fprivacy%2Fexploreyourdata%2Fdownload).
2. Sign In.
3. Complete 2-step verification by entering code from SMS if asked.
4. Click the button under 'Request a copy of your Uber data'.
5. Once the request is initiated, in the "Why are you requesting your data" box that pops up, please choose "To learn more about the data Uber has", and submit the form.
6. Please monitor your email for notification that the download is ready. When it is made available, you will need to download it. You will need to be logged into the correct Uber account to access the download.

## Subject Access Request Instructions

1. Open these instructions on a big screen (your laptop, desktop or tablet will be fine, but phone is not recommended)
2. In your web browser, go to [this contact form](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/submit-a-privacy-inquiry?nodeId=489292a2-27ce-42f5-9a47-d4dd017559fd)
3. Under "I am a", select "Rider or Uber Eats user" select three options:
  - "I would like to request a copy of my data" AND
  - "I would like to contact Uber's DPO" AND
  - "I have another question about my data"
4. In the "Why are you contacting Uber" box, where it says "select an option below", copy and paste the text from below the line. It will not all be visible within the unreasonably small box, but it is all there after you paste it.
5. Press Submit.
6. You should receive email confirmation that the request has been sent.
7. Now, please monitor the account email address regularly for acknowledgements, questions or updates, and contact us with any updates or questions. The data should be made available as a link after 30 days, which you can access when you log in to your Uber account and then click the link in the email.

### Subject Access Request: Template Request Text

```
Dear Data Protection Officer for Uber,

This message is a transparency request under the General Data Protection Regulation, including a subject access request, a portability request, and other specific provisions. Please note that it is not legal to require data subjects to use an in-house form[1].

I would like to request a copy of all my personal data held and/or undergoing processing. This is both a subject access request and a portability request. This message is not in any way to be considered as a complaint.
I am aware of your automated data download service. This request goes beyond the data that your automated download service makes available, therefore please process this request manually rather than referring me to the download service.

COPIES OF MY PERSONAL DATA

This request covers all my personal data, from usage of both your app and your website, including specifically all data belonging to each of the following categories:

1. Volunteered data - data that I have explicitly shared with you
2. Observed data - data that you have collected about me and my activity through my use of the service or through interactions with your staff
3. Derived data - data you have created and stored about me as a result of analysis, processing or inspection of my data or service activity.
4. Acquired data - data you have acquired from any external sources including e.g. credit checks, other users or advertiser‚Äôs lists.
5. Sharing & Handling data - all metadata and handling information (as detailed below) about who you have shared my data with, as well as copies of the specific data that has been shared, and details of how you have stored and handled and processed my specific data.
6. Consents - where you rely on my consent to process my personal data, please provide details of those consents including when and by what means I gave consent, and the scope of that consent, and how I might change that consent if I wanted to.

In particular, please make sure that all personal data you state in your privacy policy you collect, create, store or share is provided. Please also make sure to include data for which you remain controller that is held by third parties.

For any of these categories where you do not hold any data about me, please explicitly confirm that you do not hold any data of that type about me.

ARTICLE 20

For data falling within the right to data portability (GDPR article 20), which includes all data I have provided and which have been indirectly observed about me [2] and where lawful bases for processing include consent or contract, I wish to have that data:

- sent to me in commonly used, structured, machine-readable format, such as a CSV file. A PDF is not a machine-readable format [3].

- accompanied with an intelligible description of all variables or abbreviations.

ARTICLE 15

For all personal data not falling within portability, I would like to request, under the right to access (GDPR, article 15):

- a copy sent to me in electronic format. This includes any data derived about me, such as opinions, inferences, settings and preferences. Note that opinions, inferences and the like are considered personal data [4]. For data that is available to the controller in machine readable format, it must be provided to me in that form in accordance with the principle of fairness and provision of data protection by design.

If your organisation considers me a controller for whom you process

Furthermore, if your business considers me the controller of any personal data for which your business acts as processor, please provide me with all the data you process on my behalf in machine readable format in accordance with your obligation to respect my to determination of the means and purposes of processing.

METADATA ON PROCESSING

This request also includes the metadata I am entitled to under the GDPR, including details as follows:

INFORMATION ON CONTROLLERS, PROCESSORS, SOURCE AND TRANSFERS

- The identity of all joint controllers of my personal data, as well as the essence of you contracts with them (GDPR Article 26).
- Any third parties to whom data has been disclosed, named with contact details in accordance with Article 15(1)(c). Please note that the European data protection regulators have stated that by default, controllers should name precise recipients and not "categories" of recipients. If they do choose to name categories, they must justify why this is fair, and be specific, naming "the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the location of the recipients [3]. Please note that in the case of any transferred data processed on the basis of consent, there is no option to just name categories of recipients without invalidating that legal basis [5].
- If any data was not collected, observed or inferred from me directly, please provide precise information about the source of that data, including the name and contact email of the data controller(s) in question ("from which source the personal data originate", Article 14(2)(f)/15(1)(g)).
- Please confirm where my personal data is physically stored (including backups) and at the very least whether it has exited the EU at any stage (if so, please also detail the legal grounds and safeguards for such data transfers).

INFORMATION ON PURPOSES AND LEGAL BASIS

- All processing purposes and the lawful basis for those purposes by category of personal data. This list must be broken down by purpose, lawful basis aligned to purposes, and categories of data concerned aligned to purposes and lawful bases. Separate lists where these three factors do not correspond are not acceptable (Article 29 Working Party [6]). A table may be the best way to display this information.
- The specified legitimate interest where legitimate interest is relied upon (Article 14(2)(b)).

INFORMATION ON AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING

- Please confirm whether or not you make any automated decisions (within the meaning of Article 22, GDPR). If the answer is yes, please provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me. (Article 15(1)(h))

INFORMATION ON STORAGE

- Please confirm for how long each category of personal data is stored, or the criteria used to make this decision, in accordance with the storage limitation principle and Article 15(1)(d).

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

I understand that according to Article 11 GDPR, and particularly Art 11.2, you might need additional information to identify me for the purpose of this request. I have provided this data in the form of my Facebook profile URL within your contact form. If you need any further information please contact me.

If you do not normally deal with these requests, please pass this email to your Data Protection Officer. If you need advice on dealing with this request, any European Data Protection Authority should be able to provide you with assistance.

In accordance with the law, I look forward to hearing from you within one month of receipt.
