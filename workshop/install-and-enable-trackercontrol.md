# How to install and enable TrackerControl on Android

[TrackerControl](https://trackercontrol.org/) is an app for Android that allows you to monitor *where the apps that you use are connecting to*. It does this by installing a VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection on your phone, through which all apps' internet connections must travel. The purpose of running TrackerControl to monitor your apps for a period is to generate a CSV file of app activity that can be explored using [our TrackerControl data viewer](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/tracker-control) which digs deeper into the data than the TrackerControl app itself.

## Steps to install and enable Tracker Control

1. Install the app from the Play Store ([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kollnig.missioncontrol.play)).
2. Load up the TC Slim app.
3. Ensure the switch at the top right is pushed to the right, meaning tracking is ON.
