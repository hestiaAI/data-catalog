# How to enable Google's location tracking

There are three stages to this process: 

1. First, you must enable Google Location recording within your google account, as it is turned off by default. 
2. Second, you must ensure that your phone permissions are set correctly so that Google can track your location and send details to the server. 
3. Third, you should move around with your phone for an hour or a day and then go online and check if is working.

Please follow the steps below to learn how to do these things in detail.

## Step 1: Enable Location History in your Google Account

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com then ensure that you are logged in with the correct google account that you will use with your phone (if not, then log out first and log into the right account).
2. Go to https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols and ensure Location History is turned on.

3. If your device (the phone you want to enable tracking on) is already listed, then check the checkbox next to its name. 
4. Changes will be saved automatically. We recommend keeping Auto Delete off.

## Step 2: Enable Location tracking on your phone

These instructions are for Android, and were tested on a Samsung Galaxy. The exact location of menus may differ slightly depending on your phone model.

1. On your phone, open up the Settings app.
2. Go the the 'Location' section.

5. Find Google Maps in the list, and set it to Allow All the time.

6. Also enable "Use Precise Location"
7. Open up Google Maps, press the blue dot so it locates you.

8. Ensure that any permission requests that popup are accepted and that a blue dot surrounded by a lighter blue circle shows your correct location on the map.
9. Now, go to https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols. You should see your device name listed under Devices under Location History if you did not previously. Ensure it has a tick.

## Step 3: Check that locations have been recorded

1. Move around some different areas while carrying your phone (different buildings/streets not just different rooms).
2. Come back to your computer and visit https://timeline.google.com/. 
3. Ensure that it says "Location History is On" at the bottom.

4. You should see a log of your recent locations which can be explored geographically by panning & zooming the map, or by day, using the date selector on the top left.
5. If you see no data, please revisit Step 1 and 2.
