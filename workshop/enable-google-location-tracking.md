# How to enable Google's location tracking

There are three stages to this process: 

1. First, you must enable Google Location recording within your google account, as it is turned off by default. 
2. Second, you must ensure that your phone permissions are set correctly so that Google can track your location and send details to the server. 
3. Third, you should move around with your phone for an hour or a day and then go online and check if is working.

Please follow the steps below to learn how to do these things in detail.

## Step 1: Enable Location History in your Google Account

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com then ensure that you are logged in with the correct google account that you will use with your phone (if not, then log out first and log into the right account).
2. Go to https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols and ensure Location History is turned on.

3. If your device (the phone you want to enable tracking on) is already listed, then check the checkbox next to its name. 
4. Changes will be saved automatically. We recommend keeping Auto Delete off.

## Step 2: Enable Location reporting on your phone

This will vary depending on your phone model. The general process is to go to your Settings app (or settings pulldown), find the Location switch, and enable it.

As a pulldown toggle, it might look something like this, where blue is ON:

As a Settings switch, it might look something like this, where right/blue is ON:

## Step 3: Check that locations have been recorded

1. Move around some different areas while carrying your phone (different buildings/streets not just different rooms).
2. Come back to your computer and visit https://timeline.google.com/. 
3. Ensure that it says "Location History is On" at the bottom. (this is also where you can easily turn off Location History later, after you are finished with the workshops).

4. You should see a log of your recent locations which can be explored geographically by panning & zooming the map, or by day, using the date selector on the top left.
5. If you see no data, please revisit Step 1 and 2.
