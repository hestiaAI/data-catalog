# Getting your data from Fitbit

To get your data from Fitbit, please follow the following steps:

1. Go to https://www.fitbit.com/settings/data/export.
2. Log in.
3. Make sure to use the *second* export option, called "Export Account Archive". 
  - (if you need a response quickly, you can instantly download a CSV of up to 31 days activity log data using the 'Your Fitbit Data' at the top and save that file off, but JSON format is only available from the account archive)
4. Hit the Request Data button to request your entire account data. You get an email within 30 minutes when it is ready.
5. Then download that data file.
