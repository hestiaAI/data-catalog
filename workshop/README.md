# Transport Lausanne / Hestia.ai Workshop

## Important Pre-Workshop Preparation Steps

In order to prepare for the workshops on May 17th and June 13th, there are a number of steps to complete. All of these need to be completed *BEFORE MAY 13TH*. 
Subject Access Requests have to be done one month before the June 13th workshop, in order to give the target companies the legally required 30 days to respond to Subject Access Requests. Portal requests need to be completed a few days before the May 17th workshop, as some companies take more than a few hours, sometimes several days, to respond.
