# How to export data from TrackerControl

Before you can export data with TrackerControl you need to have enabled tracking and used some apps for a while so they can be monitored. See [this page](https://github.com/hestiaAI/data-catalog/blob/main/workshop/install-and-enable-trackercontrol.md) for more information.

## Steps to export TrackerControl data.

1. Once some data has been generated, load up TrackerControl app. Stay on the main page (if you have viewed a specific app, go back to the main page where all apps are listed).

2. Press the three dots on the top right:

3. Select Export as CSV.

4. Confirm (or optionally modify) the suggested filename. (optionally you can change the directory where the file is saved at this step too):

6. You can now transfer this CSV file from phone storage to your desktop/laptop machine you will use in the workshops, using whatever means is easiest for you (USB transfer, email attachment, Signal message to self, etc). CSV files from TrackerControl can be loaded into our viewer.
